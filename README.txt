---------------
1. UW Boundless requires Bootstrap 7.x-3.0 base-theme. Download Bootstrap 3 for Drupal (https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap).

Creating a sub-theme
---------------
The following instructions are based on the "Creating a sub-theme" page of the Drupal Theming guide (https://www.drupal.org/node/225125)

1. Folder "subtheme"
Create a new folder in the sites/[all|my_sitename]/themes/ location of your drupal installation. 
This folder should have the same name as the internal name of the your sub-theme (e.g., subtheme).

2. File "subtheme.info"
Copy the uw_boundless.info file to you sub-theme folder and rename it to the name of your sub-theme (e.g. subtheme.info)
Edit your subtheme.info file by changing the "name" and "description" values to your liking. 
Don't change the "core" value. 
Change the "base theme" value to uw_boundless.

The first lines of your subtheme.info file should now look something like this:
name = My theme name
description = A UW Boundless sub-theme description
core = 7.x
base theme = uw_boundless

2a. Regions inheritance
Drupal sub-themes do not inherit regions, so keep the regions declarations as-is in your subtheme.info file.

2b. Style sheet inheritance
You must declare at least one stylesheet in your sub-theme for any of the parent theme's stylesheets to be inherited.
Keep the style sheet declaration as-is:
stylesheets[all][] = css/style.css

Copy the css folder (and its content) from the uw_boundless theme folder to your sub-theme folder.
Your sub-theme's folder and file structure should now look something like this:
subtheme/
--subtheme.info
--css/
----assets/
----style.css
----style.css.map

2c. JavaScript inheritance
All scripts defined in the uw_boundless theme will be inherited.
Disable or remove all scripts[] declarations from your subtheme.info file.

2d. Theme settings inheritance
All theme settings defined in the uw_boundless theme will be inherited.
Disable or remove all settings[uw_boundless_...] declarations from your subtheme.info file.

3. Enable your subtheme
Navigate to Administration > Appearance and enable your sub-theme as the default theme.

4. Configuration
Step through the theme configuration instructions as described above (in particular 3.BootstrapCDN, 10.Breadcrumbs and 11.Region-wells) 
to reset some settings.

5. Customize
You're now ready to further customize your subtheme.
